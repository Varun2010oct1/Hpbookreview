        <p>My favourite hobby is reading books. I like it because it is really interesting and fun to read books. My favourite types of books are horror, fantasy, and comedy. The following is about Harry Potter, my favourite book/movie series.</p>

        <p>The storyline of the whole series (8 books) is pretty amazing. One does not need a very advanced mind to read it. From a 6 year old to an adult, the storyline is so intriguing that it can keep anyone hooked up for hours. Overall, I would say that it’s a well-thought and well-executed series. Rowling has given such twists and mysteries in every chapter of each book that it is difficult to keep it down once you start reading it. But, I found some flaws in the eighth book.

If you read a really nice book which is the first in a series, your expectations for the next ones automatically rise. But, Rowling left no effort in delivering that requirement of a reader and delivered the greatest pieces of fantasy literature ever written. The series originally had 7 books, but after the release of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child in 2016, it now has 8 books. The story of this book revolves around Harry’s son, Albus, who has problems coping up with his peers in school due to his father’s high reputation. But, the story did not have any twists or secrets like the earlier books, and it also did not have as any magical elements. For me, this book only revolved around a time-turner. Rowling could have improvised a bit in this particular book. But in other books, she has done an excellent and fantabulous job.</p>
